READ ME - CHESS.py

For my term project, I developed an app to play chess with an AI feature. There
are two modes, one-player and two-player, so the user can decide to play with
a friend or against the computer. 

To run the project, the user must run the files, chess.py and chessAI.py, 
in VSCode or any IDE of their choice along with the cmu_112_graphics.py file, 
which includes no modifications and must be in the same folder. No external
modules, hardware, and/or technologies are necessary. Additionally, no libraries
need to be installed.
